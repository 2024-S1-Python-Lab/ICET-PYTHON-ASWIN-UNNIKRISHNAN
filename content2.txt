Sometimes legitimate newspapers, magazines, and television shows publish news that is real, but the way they present the news is misleading. Here the New York Daily News, a paper that has been in publication since 1919, published a story in which the headline claims that sugar is as addictive as cocaine and heroin. That's a very frightening headline, isn't it?! I'm sure it caught your eye. And that's the point.  Stories like this are often referred to as "Clickbait." They have terrifying headlines that don't always give you the whole story.  If you were to read more of the article, you would discover that this theory has only been proven to exist in rats, not humans.
